In this workflow, I implements the UI logic primary with `Script Filter <https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/>`_. The Script caller syntax is always ``/usr/bin/python main.py handler_identifier '{query}'``. I choose to use this syntax and manage the arg-parse, python function call with in application code because it's easier to manage and debug. The ``handler_identifier`` is unique key for a ``handler function`` so the python code can locate which ``handler function`` to call. The ``handler function`` is simply a normal python function that has only one parameter ``wf``, representing the ``workflow.workflow3.Workflow3`` object.
